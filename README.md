# TeamScores

**Small Elixir application that models a basic trading card score aggregator. This application will receive a list of trading cards (represented by structs or maps) that include player name, team, and a score based on the card's rarity and condition. Your task is to calculate the total score for a given team**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `team_scores` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [

end
```
